                    <p className="about__text">Since graduating from the University of Waterloo in Kinesiology and Computer Science, I have been 
                        working towards kickstarting a career in web development through bootcamps, side projects, and networking. 
                        As a recent web development graduate from Brainstation, I am excited to complete the program with a toolkit full 
                        of technologies and problem-solving skills to become a successful web developer. I hope to be able to bring 
                        intelligent designs to life and contribute to positive user experiences on the web.</p>

                            Given the problem of increasing fan engagement, our strategy focussed on connecting to the user on a personal level by 
                            leveraging the WNBA players as influencers, leaning into paid advertisement, and incorporating sharing functions within the app.
                            Mockups and discussions were done using Figma and a prototype of the app was built to showcase our vision to the WBNA panel.</p>
